# Why String is immutable in Java?


There are several reasons why String is immutable in Java.

* **Thread safety:** Since String objects are immutable, they can be safely shared between multiple threads without the need for synchronization. This is because the value of a String object cannot change once it has been created, so there is no risk of one thread modifying the value of a String object that is being used by another thread.
* **Performance:** String objects are immutable because it makes them more efficient to access. When a String object is immutable, the JVM can cache the value of the object in memory, which can significantly improve performance. This is because the JVM does not need to check the value of the object every time it is accessed, as it knows that the value cannot change.
* **Simplicity:** Making String objects immutable makes the Java language simpler to use. This is because it removes the need to worry about the possibility of a String object being modified after it has been created. This can make code more readable and easier to debug.
