# Why is Java a platform independent language?

By relying on a virtual machine, Java achieves
platform independence. In practice, this means
that both the Java programming language and
its associated APIs are first compiled into
bytecodes that can run on multiple platforms.
Then, the virtual machine handles any
variations in how these bytecodes are executed
across different platforms
