# What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?


Final is used to make a variable or method
constant and cannot be changed later.
Finally is
used in try-catch blocks to execute a block of
code regardless of whether an exception is
thrown or not. 
Finalise is a method that is called
by the garbage collector when an object is no
longer in use.
