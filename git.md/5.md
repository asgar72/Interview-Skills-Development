# What does git status command do?
The git status command is used to display the current state of the Git repository. It shows information about any modifications, additions, or deletions of files in the working directory and staging area. The command provides a summary of the changes and helps you track the status of your files in relation to the repository, allowing you to determine which files are modified, which are staged for commit, and which are untracked.
